    <h1>Start from your previous Spotify Exercise.</h1>

    <p>
      The goal of this exercise is to fetch data from the API instead of having
      them "hardcoded" in the page.
    </p>

    <p>
      Subscribe to RapidAPI, it will take some time for the key to arrive in
      your email
    </p>
    <p>Then go to: https://rapidapi.com/it/deezerdevs/api/deezer-1</p>

    <p>
      Generate 3 lists based on the "Search API" response of the fetch() method
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>es.: https://deezerdevs-deezer.p.rapidapi.com/search?q=eminem</li>
      <li>es.: https://deezerdevs-deezer.p.rapidapi.com/search?q=metallica</li>
      <li>es.: https://deezerdevs-deezer.p.rapidapi.com/search?q=behemoth</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>
      Load them during page load, and create the collections based on the API
      response.
    </h3>

    <h4>
      Make the central portion of the page scrollable both horizontally and
      vertically.
    </h4>

    <h4>
      Add a "List albums" button. When pressed, it should create and display a
      list of albums on the page.
    </h4>

    <h4>
      Add a "Count Unique" button. When pressed, it should log the number of
      unique albums on the page.
